Detective
===========

Web interface for managing Syslog-ng messages.

Detective is based on the sinatra framework.
It's a simple request/show form to view syslog events in a web interface.

For the moment it use sqlite database.
As syslog-ng usualy log into mysql database I will look forward to it.
